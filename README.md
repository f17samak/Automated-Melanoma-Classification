# Automated Melanoma Classification

This implementation was built as part of my bachelor thesis at the University of Jena, Germany. The focus of the work was to build a classifier which is able to distinguish skin lesions between being *malign* or *benign* with the help of a (deep) convolutional neural network.


### Datasets

The major part of my used data can be obtained from the [ISIC Archive](https://isic-archive.com/) with the help of the [ISIC-Data-Downloader](https://github.com/vgupta-ai/ISIC-Dataset-Downloader).
